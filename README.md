# Notes
## Introduction and Basics

This section provides an introduction to GoLang, its key features, and covers the basic syntax including variables, data types, operators, and control structures. It also includes a "Hello, World!" example.

For detailed notes and examples, check out the [Introduction and Basics](Notes/Introduction_and_Basics.md) file.

## Data Types and Variables

Learn about different data types in GoLang and how to declare and initialize variables.

For detailed notes and examples, check out the [Data Types and Variables](Notes/Data_Types_and_Variables.md) file.

## Functions

Explore function declaration, arguments, return values, and more.

For detailed notes and examples, check out the [Functions](Notes/functions.md) file.

## Control Structures

Understand conditional statements (if), switch statements, and loops (for and range).

For detailed notes and examples, check out the [Control Structures](Notes/Control_Structures.md) file.
